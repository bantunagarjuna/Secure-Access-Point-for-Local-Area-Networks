# Secure-Access-Point-for-Local-Area-Networks

**Project Overview**

The essence of this project is to establish a wireless access point tailored for small network environments, with a strong on secure connectivity and file sharing capabilities. The initiative is driven by the need for robust security measures in network communication, particularly within confined spaces such as college department blocks.

**Technical Implementation**

At the core of this solution is the Raspberry Pi 4B, which has been meticulously configured to serve as a wireless access point. This transformation is made possible through the use of Hostapd configurations, which enable the device to broadcast a secure Wi-Fi signal to nearby users. To complement this setup, the MQTT protocol has been integrated to facilitate secure file sharing. This protocol ensures that data transmission between devices is not only swift but also protected against unauthorized access.

**Application and Impact**

The deployment of this project within college departments can revolutionize the way research data is shared among peers. By creating a dedicated and secure network for data exchange, we can significantly mitigate the risk of sensitive information leaking onto the public internet. This approach not only safeguards intellectual property but also fosters a collaborative environment where researchers can share their findings with confidence.

**Conclusion**

In summary, this project stands as the innovative use of technology in enhancing network security and data sharing efficiency. It is a scalable model that can be adapted to various settings, promising a future where data integrity and privacy are upheld with utmost priority.
